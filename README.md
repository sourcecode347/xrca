# XRCA USAGE

XRCA is text encryption and decryption, you create 2 keys each person , one public and one private.

You exchange public keys with the other person you want to communicate encrypted with him , then each person encrypts text with the other's person public key and sends it to him to decrypt with his private key.

I hope you can manage to keep your communications private
